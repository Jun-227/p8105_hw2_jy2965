## Problem 1

# read and clean data

**Mr. Trash Wheel
sheet**

``` r
trash_data = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx","Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N408" )  %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(weight= weight_tons, volume = volume_cubic_yards) %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls, digits = 0),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
)
```

In above chunk, I managed to do: 1.specify the sheet in the Excel file
and to omit non-data entries (rows with notes / figures; columns
containing notes) using arguments in read\_excel 2.use reasonable
variable names 3.omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
4.round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts
the result to an integer variable (using as.integer)

**data for 2017 and
2018**

``` r
precipitation_2017 = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx","2017 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14" )  %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
   year = 2017
)
precipitation_2018 = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx","2018 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14" )  %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
   year = 2018
)

combine_precipitation = bind_rows(precipitation_2017,precipitation_2018) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>% 
  select(year, everything())
```

**description** The dataset “trash\_data” contains the data from the
first sheet of the “Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx” file.
This data has 344 rows, 14 columns and 344 observations. Besides, this
dataset has 14 variables. Taking “weight” as an example, dumpster1
collected 4.31 tons of trash on May 16th, 2014.

The dataset “combine\_precipitation” combines the data from “2017
precipitation” and “2018 preciptation” sheet of the
“Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx” file. This data has 24
rows, 3 colums and 24 observations. Besides, this dataset has 3
variables. For example, the total precipetation in January 2017 is 2.34.
**answer the question** For available data, what was the total
precipitation in 2018? What was the median number of sports balls in a
dumpster in 2017? The total precipitation in 2018 is 32.93. The median
number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 is 8

## Problem 2

**data in pols-month.csv**

``` r
pols_month = read_csv(file = "./data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[as.integer(month)],
         president = prez_gop+prez_dem
         ) %>% 
  select(-prez_dem,-prez_gop,-day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),

  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[as.integer(month)]) %>% 
  select(year, month, close)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(

  pivot_longer(January:December, names_to = "month", values_to = "unemployment") %>% 
mutate(
  year=as.character(year)
)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),

    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

**merge dataset**

``` r
merge_data = left_join(pols_month, snp_data, by = c("year","month"))

merge_data_new = left_join(merge_data, unemployment_data, by = c("year","month"))
```

\#\#Problem 3 **import and tidy
data**

``` r
popular_name = read_csv(file = "./data/Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>% janitor::clean_names() %>% 
distinct() 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   `Year of Birth` = col_double(),
    ##   Gender = col_character(),
    ##   Ethnicity = col_character(),
    ##   `Child's First Name` = col_character(),

popular_name$ethnicity = sub(pattern = "BLACK NON HISPANIC", replacement = "BLACK NON HISP", popular_name$ethnicity)
popular_name$ethnicity = sub(pattern = "WHITE NON HISPANIC", replacement = "WHITE NON HISP", popular_name$ethnicity)
```

**Produce a well-structured, reader-friendly table showing the rank in
popularity of the name “Olivia” as a female baby name over
time**

``` r
olivia_table = filter(popular_name, childs_first_name %in% "Olivia") %>% 
  select(ethnicity, rank, year_of_birth) %>% 
pivot_wider(
  names_from = "year_of_birth", 
  values_from = "rank")
knitr::kable(olivia_table)
```

| ethnicity      | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013 |
| :------------- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ASIAN AND PACI |    1 |    1 |    1 |    3 |
| BLACK NON HISP |    8 |    4 |    8 |    6 |
| HISPANIC       |   13 |   16 |   16 |   22 |
| WHITE NON HISP |    1 |    1 |    1 |    1 |

**the most popular name among male children over time.**

``` r
top_name = filter(popular_name, rank == 1 & gender == "MALE") %>% 
  select(childs_first_name,ethnicity, year_of_birth) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
  names_from = "year_of_birth", 
  values_from = "childs_first_name")
knitr::kable(top_name)
```

| ethnicity      | 2016   | 2015   | 2014   | 2013   | 2012   | 2011    |

**Scatter plot** for male, white non-hispanic children born in 2016,
produce a scatter plot showing the number of children with a name (y
axis) against the rank in popularity of that name (x
axis)

``` r
plot_table = filter(popular_name, gender == "MALE" & ethnicity == "WHITE NON HISP" & year_of_birth == 2016)
ggplot(plot_table, aes(x = rank, y = count)) + 
  geom_point()
